#          SuperCollider Audio Settings
#
#

## Introduction
## ============
#
# Sonic Pi uses the SuperCollider audio server to generate all the
# lovely sounds you can hear.
#
# SuperCollider is a powerful and flexible open source sound system with
# a lot of configuration options. Whilst we do a lot of work to
# configure everything with sensible defaults, there are times you may
# wish or need to change a few options to improve things on your
# system. For example, you may wish to use a specific sound card,
# audio rate, number of inputs, etc. All of this is possible by
# modifying this file prior to launching Sonic Pi.
#
# Note that this file is a simple Toml config file. You can read more
# about Toml here: https://github.com/toml-lang/toml.


## How to use this file
## ===================
#
# Firstly it's important to understand that this file is not necessary
# to start Sonic Pi. Without this file, Sonic Pi will try its best to
# figure out the most sensible options for your platform.
#
# Just to be clear - this config file is meant just to override specific
# options. Options not specifically mentioned here will be given
# platform-specific default values.

# The exception to this is the scsynth_opts_override option which will
# completely override and clobber any other settings in this file in
# addition to overriding any defaults. If scsynth_opts_override exists,
# then its value will be passed straight to SuperCollider's scsynth
# unmodified as the only options. This typically should not be used, but
# is provided as an emergency escape hatch in case it is necessary for
# very unique situations.
#
# Each line that starts with a # is a comment and is therefore ignored
# by the computer. This line that you're reading is actually a comment.
#
# In order to make one of the following configuration lines active, you
# need to remove the # at the beginning of the line.
#
# Once the # is removed, you can then modify the value on the right hand
# side of the = to pass a new option.
#
# For example, if your sound card is set to an audio rate of 48000, you can
# tell Sonic Pi to use that rate too by finding the following line:
# # sound_card_sample_rate = 44100
# and then changing it to:
# sound_card_sample_rate = 48000

# Note, if there are any syntax issues with this file, then a warning will be
# logged and Sonic Pi will continue to boot as if this file didn't
# exist.

# Good luck and happy live coding!

## Escape hatch
## ============
##
## These options are provided for the rare times where it's impossible
## to configure the audio settings with the options above and the
## defaults.
##
## scsynth_opts is a string with standard command line opts in the
## format that SuperCollider scsynth expects. This will be appended to
## any other opts specified in this file and to any defaults

# scsynth_opts = ""

## scsynth_opts_override is a string with standard command line opts in
## the format that SuperCollider scsynth expects. If used and non-empty,
## this will override and replace any other settings in this file and
## any defaults.
##

# scsynth_opts_override = ""
