require 'fileutils'

# Simple script to nuke all non lib dirs in the vendor tree. Useful for
# pruning an app pre release. Be very Careful as it will nuke everything
# recursively in a dir. Has a basic safety check (looks for
# app/server/vendor in the path) and by default doesn't do anything
# unless you change rehearse to false.  Try not to nuke the wrong
# things!

# Call with:
# ./prune.rb path/to/vendor/dir

dir = ARGV[0]

rehearse = false


subdirs = Dir["#{dir}/*/*"].select{|d| File.directory?(d) && (File.basename(d) != "lib")}

puts dir
if !subdirs.empty?
  raise "Aborting prune. Doesn't look like you're using an app/server/ruby/vendor dir" unless subdirs.first.match(/app\/server\/ruby\/vendor/)

  if rehearse

    puts subdirs
    puts "Aborting prune operation. Turn rehearse off to remove files."
