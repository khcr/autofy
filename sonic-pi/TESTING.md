# Testing and Profiling

This is a short document to help out anyone who wants to
contribute to development of Sonic Pi. To do that you should
try to use (and add to) the test suites.

## Running the tests

Sonic Pi doesn't have a database, so the tests are quite a lot
simpler than your average web app.

```
$ cd app/server/sonicpi/test
$ rake test
```

This should run all the tests for you. 

If you have an error like this:

```
Warning: you should require 'minitest/autorun' instead.
Warning: or add 'gem "minitest"' before 'require "minitest/autorun"'
```

You may find you need to run the following.

```
$ gem install test-unit
```

## Profiling

Sonic Pi is a truly multi-threaded system with communications via OSC
(open sound control) being sent between the Qt GUI, the Ruby server and
the scsynth synthesis server. As a result, profiling has proved to be tricky.

### Profiling the Ruby server

The following is a suggestion for how one might go about profiling the Ruby
elements of Sonic Pi. This assumes you are using Ruby 2.1 or greater.

1. `gem install ruby-prof`
2. (optional) Clone [this repo](https://github.com/xavriley/tinyosc), run `build.sh` followed by `./tinyosc 4557`
 This is just to provide a receiver for the OSC message that are sent to the GUI
on port 4557. If you don't do this you'll see some error messages to do with connections.
3. `gem install sonic-pi-cli` - for version 2.7 dev and above you may need to install from this repo: https://github.com/xavriley/sonic-pi-cli
4. Run this command from the root dir of Sonic Pi

```
$ ruby-prof -p multi ./app/server/ruby/bin/sonic-pi-server.rb
```

5. Run this command (again from the root dir) to send some code to Sonic Pi

```
$ cat etc/examples/wizard/tilburg.rb | sonic_pi
```

6. After letting it run for a while, run `sonic_pi stop` in a fresh terminal
and then Ctrl+C the sonic-pi-server.rb process. This should create several
files in the root folder containing profiling information.
