2.2 Synth Options

# Synth Options: Amp and Pan

As well as allowing you to control which note to play or which sample to
trigger, Sonic Pi provides a whole range of options to craft and
control the sounds. We'll be covering many of these in this tutorial and
there's extensive documentation for each in the help system. However,
for now we'll introduce two of the most useful: *amplitude* and *pan*.
First, let's look at what options actually are.


## Options

Sonic Pi supports the notion of options (or opts for short) for its
synths. Opts are controls you pass to `play` which modify and
control aspects of the sound you hear. Each synth has its own set of
opts for finely tuning its sound. However, there are common sets
of opts shared by many sounds such as `amp:` and envelope
opts (covered in another section).

Opts have two major parts, their name (the name of the control) and
their value (the value you want to set the control at). For example, you
might have an opt called `cheese:` and want to set it with a value
of `1`.

Opts are passed to calls to `play` by using a comma
`,` and then the name of the opt such as `amp:` (don't forget the
colon `:`) and then a space and the value of the opt. For example:

```
play 50, cheese: 1
```

(Note that `cheese:` isn't a valid opt, we're just using it as an example).

You can pass multiple opts by separating them with a comma:

```
play 50, cheese: 1, beans: 0.5
```

The order of the opts doesn't matter, so the following is identical:

```
play 50, beans: 0.5, cheese: 1
```

Opts that aren't recognised by the synth are just ignored (like
`cheese` and `beans` which are clearly ridiculous opt names!)

If you accidentally use the same opt twice with different values, the
last one wins. For example, `beans:` here will have the value 2 rather
than 0.5:

```
play 50, beans: 0.5, cheese: 3, eggs: 0.1, beans: 2
```

Many things in Sonic Pi accept opts, so just spend a little time
learning how to use them and you'll be set! Let's play with our first
opt: `amp:`.

## Amplitude

Amplitude is a computer representation of the loudness of a sound. A
*high amplitude produces a loud sound* and a *low amplitude produces a
quiet sound*. Just as Sonic Pi uses numbers to represent time and notes,
it uses numbers to represent amplitude. An amplitude of 0 is silent
(you'll hear nothing) whereas an amplitude of 1 is normal volume. You
can even crank up the amplitude higher to 2, 10, 100. However, you
should note that when the overall amplitude of all the sounds gets too
high, Sonic Pi uses what's called a compressor to squash them all to
make sure things aren't too loud for your ears. This can often make the
sound muddy and strange. So try to use low amplitudes, i.e. in the range
0 to 0.5 to avoid compression.


## Amp it up

To change the amplitude of a sound, you can use the `amp:`
opt. For example, to play at half amplitude pass 0.5:

```
play 60, amp: 0.5
```

To play at double amplitude pass 2:

```
play 60, amp: 2
```

The `amp:` opt only modifies the call to `play` it's associated
with. So, in this example, the first call to play is at half volume and
the second is back to the default (1):

```
play 60, amp: 0.5
sleep 0.5
play 65
```

Of course, you can use different `amp:` values for each call to play:

```
play 50, amp: 0.1
sleep 0.25
play 55, amp: 0.2
sleep 0.25
play 57, amp: 0.4
sleep 0.25
play 62, amp: 1
```

## Panning

Another fun opt to use is `pan:` which controls the panning of a
sound in stereo. Panning a sound to the left means that you hear it out
of the left speaker, and panning it to the right means you hear it out
of your right speaker. For our values, we use a -1 to represent fully
left, 0 to represent center and 1 to represent fully right in the stereo
field. Of course, we're free to use any value between -1 and 1 to
control the exact positioning of our sound.

Let's play a beep out of the left speaker:

```
play 60, pan: -1
```

Now, let's play it out of the right speaker:

```
play 60, pan: 1
```

Finally let's play it back out of the center of both (the default
position):

```
play 60, pan: 0
```

Now, go and have fun changing the amplitude and panning of your sounds!
