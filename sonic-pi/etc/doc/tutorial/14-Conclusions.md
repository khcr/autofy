14 Conclusions

# Conclusions

This concludes the Sonic Pi introductory tutorial. Hopefully you've
learned something along the way. Don't worry if you feel you didn't
understand everything - just play and have fun and you'll pick things up
in your own time. Feel free to dive back in when you have a question that
might be covered in one of the sections.

If you have any questions that haven't been covered in the tutorial,
then please jump onto the [Sonic Pi community forums](https://in-thread.sonic-pi.net/)
and ask your question there. You'll find someone friendly and willing to
lend a hand.

Finally, I also invite you to take a deeper look at the rest of the
documentation in this help system. There are a number of features that
haven't been covered in this tutorial that are waiting for your
discovery.

So play, have fun, share your code, perform for your friends, show your
screens and remember:

*There are no mistakes, only opportunities.*
