12 OSC

# OSC

In addition to MIDI, another way to get information in and out of Sonic
Pi is via the network using a simple protocol called OSC - Open Sound
Control. This will let you send messages to and from external programs
(both running on your computer and on external computers) which opens up
the potential for control way beyond MIDI which has limitations due to
its 1980s design.

For example, you could write a program in another programming language
which sends and receives OSC (there are OSC libraries for pretty much
every common language) and work directly with Sonic Pi. What you can use
this for is only limited by your imagination.
