2 Synths

# Synths

OK, enough of the intros - let's get into some sound.

In this section we'll cover the basics of triggering and manipulating
synths. Synth is short for synthesiser which is a fancy word for
something which creates sounds. Typically synths are quite complicated
to use - especially analog synths such as Eurorack modules connected
together by a mess of wires. However, Sonic Pi gives you much of that
power in a very simple and approachable manner.

Don't be fooled by the immediate simplicity of Sonic Pi's interface. You
can get very deep into very sophisticated sound manipulation if that's
your thing. Hold on to your hats...
