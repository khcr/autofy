A Appendix A - MagPi Articles

# MagPi Articles

Appendix A collects all the Sonic Pi articles written for the MagPi
magazine.

## Dive into Topics

These articles aren't meant to be read in any strict order and contain a
lot of cross-over material from the tutorial itself. Rather than try and
teach you all of Sonic Pi, they instead each focus on a specific aspect
of Sonic Pi and cover it in a fun and accessible way.

## Read the MagPi

You can see them in their glorious professionally typeset form in the
free PDF downloads of The MagPi here: https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/
