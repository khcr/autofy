# Controlling running sounds

So far we've looked at how you can trigger synths and samples, and
also how to change their default opts such as amplitude, pan,
envelope settings and more. Each sound triggered is essentially its
own sound with its own list of options set for the duration of the
sound.

Wouldn't it also be cool if you could change a sound's opts whilst it's
still playing, just like you might bend a string of a guitar whilst it's
still vibrating?

You're in luck - this section will show you how to do exactly this.
