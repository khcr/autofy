# Performing

One of the most exciting aspects of Sonic Pi is that it enables you to
use code as a *musical instrument*. This means that writing code live can
now be seen as a new way of performing music.

We call this *Live Coding*.

## Show Your Screen

When you live code I recommend you *show your screen* to your
audience. Otherwise it's like playing a guitar but hiding your fingers
and the strings. When I practice at home I use a Raspberry Pi and a
little mini projector on my living room wall. You could use your TV or
one of your school/work projectors to give a show. Try it, it's a lot of
fun.

## Form a Band

Don't just play on your own - form a live coding band! It's a lot of fun
jamming with others. One person could do beats, another ambient
background, etc. Use the `live_audio` functionality to combine code with
traditional instruments such as a guitar or a microphone.

See what interesting combinations of sounds you can create with code.

## TOPLAP

Live coding isn't completely new - a small number of people have been
doing it for a few years now, typically using bespoke systems they've
built for themselves. A great place to go and find out more about other
live coders and systems is [TOPLAP](http://toplap.org).

## Algorave

Another great resource for exploring the live coding world is
[Algorave](http://algorave.com). Here you can find all about a specific
strand of live coding for making music in nightclubs.
