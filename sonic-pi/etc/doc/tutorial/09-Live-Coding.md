9 Live Coding

# Live Coding

One of the most exciting aspects of Sonic Pi is that it enables you to
write and modify code live to make music, just like you might perform
live with a guitar. One advantage of this approach is to give you more
feedback whilst composing (get a simple loop running and keep tweaking
it till it sounds just perfect). However, the main advantage is that you
can take Sonic Pi on stage and gig with it.

In this section we'll cover the fundamentals of turning your static code
compositions into dynamic performances.
