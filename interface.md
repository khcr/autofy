## Interactive interface

The interface is basically seperate in two collumns. The right one have three different settings button. The highest is the play/pause button which is clickable. The second, controls the BPM of the music. And the most important one, we called it : "The mood controler pannel". Each axis have six stages and you can click on the pannel to change the mood of the song.
The second collumns controls all possible background effect or ambiance that you want. By clicking on them you can have sound from a particular weather or a particular place in background of the music. Also you could see the background image changing depending on which background you choose.
